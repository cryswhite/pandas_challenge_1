# pandas_challenge_1
Week 4 assignment 
# Summary of Data Analysis Project Assistance

Note to Grader:
    This assignment was less frustrating than Python has been, but only because in my job as a researcher and analyst, I spend many, many hours combing over thousands of rows of data. In this, I would like to comment that I could not understand why the values I was coming up with for Part 2 did not match the values in the "Confirm Your Work" section of Part 3. So, I exported my VS Code file to .csv and opened in Excel, pulling out and analyzing the Order IDs I needed, and the numbers still came out the same and didn't match. That led me to believe that one of two things may be happening: The first was that, for some reason, I had dropped Order IDs as I was manipulating the code, causing my totals to be less than what the assignment said. The other option was that the values the assignment provided were incorrect. I used 3 different variations of statements for Pandas with various calculations, and the output from my dataframe still matched the output in my .csv file but did not match the assignment details. I don't know where I went wrong, but I can't figure out what to fix. So, I'm leaving as is and just noting it here. 

    Also, I used ChatGPT (my "AI Bootcamp Buddy"), Bard, _Python Programming for Dummies_, GitHub Copilot and Googled my butt off to find variations. But, I can't say specifically what I used where because I cobbled it all together with not a small amount of Notepad to save versions of code snippets as I tried various things. I also used "Buddy" to document our work together which you will see below.
